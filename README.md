# Data analysis on Airbnb's open data on Seattle listings

*Installation

You need Anaconda's distribution of Python version 3 to run this. To run  the analysis you'll need to download the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle and put the Jupyter Notebook in the same folder.

*Project Motivation

I ran data analysis on Airbnb's open data on Seattle listings by answering 3 questions:

The best time to visit Seattle
Best and worst neighborhoods
Are hosts who have a high review score rating charging renters more?

*File Descriptions

There is 1 Jupyter Notebook in this project which has all the code and analysis.

*Acknowledgements

Data is taken from Airbnb's Open Data source on Seattle listings in conjunction with Kaggle.
